      <UL>
        <li>Git is a verson control software that we can use to track changes in our code.</li>
        <li>Is currently the most used version control software among developers.</li>
        <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally, but to collobarate with others you need GitHub.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service to keep track of our projects inside repositories stored remotely.</li>
        <li>Some of the most important common terms to understand when using GitHub include:</li>
        <li>Repository (Repo):  A folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.</li>
        <li>Branch:  A work space where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
        <li>A new branch is created to enclose the changes when you want to fix a bug or add new features.</li>
        <li>Issues:  Allows a developer to report new tasks and current fixes, and track progress of the project from beginning to end.</li>
        <li>To commit and push up work created in your local environment to GitHub is quite a detailed process.</li>
        <li>Prework lessons revealed the challenges of gaining a good grasp/working knowledge of Git & GitHub will be a significant part of this course.</li>
        <li>The Command Line Interface (CLI) will be used to input text commands in relation to Git & GitHub.</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT:  All Git commands start with the work git, as per examples below.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <Li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</Li>
