          <li>IMPORTANT - HTML has critical role in ensuring the webpage looks good and is functional.</li>
          <Li>Includes elements designed to assist in presentation i.e. different levels of headings, paragraphs, sections etc.</Li>
          <li>Elements can be nestled inside other elements, referred to as parent/child elements.</li>
          <li>The closing tag includes a forward slash.</LI>

          <li>CSS class is an attribute to define a group of unique elements to apply unique formatting.</li>
          <li>An element selector or tag selector selects all the elements by their specified name.</li>
          <li>A class selector selects all elements with a specified class attribute.</li>
          <li>Inline style uses a CSS rule to apply a unique style to an specific page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the particlular webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is where the rules are in a separate file, linked using a link element.</li>
          <li>Using a wild card symbol * will apply a rule to all elements on a web page.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <UL>
        <li>Git is a verson control software that we can use to track changes in our code.</li>
        <li>Is currently the most used version control software among developers.</li>
        <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally, but to collobarate with others you need GitHub.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service to keep track of our projects inside repositories stored remotely.</li>
        <li>Some of the most important common terms to understand when using GitHub include:</li>
        <li>Repository (Repo):  A folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.</li>
        <li>Branch:  A work space where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
        <li>A new branch is created to enclose the changes when you want to fix a bug or add new features.</li>
        <li>Issues:  Allows a developer to report new tasks and current fixes, and track progress of the project from beginning to end.</li>
        <li>To commit and push up work created in your local environment to GitHub is quite a detailed process.</li>
        <li>Prework lessons revealed the challenges of gaining a good grasp/working knowledge of Git & GitHub will be a significant part of this course.</li>
        <li>The Command Line Interface (CLI) will be used to input text commands in relation to Git & GitHub.</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT:  All Git commands start with the work git, as per examples below.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

      <H2>JavaScript</H2>
      <UL>
        <li>Is a high level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>Will spend a little over half the time in the bootcamp on it.</li>
        <li>Some of the features of JavaScript include:</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>A string is a data type which is is made up of sequence of text, with each value enclosed in single quotation marks.</li>
        <li>A Boolean is a True/False value; true and false are keywords so do not need quotation marks.</li>
        <li>An array is a structure that allows the developer to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
        <li>Within an array the first item has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
        <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code; they will be ignored by Javascript.</li>
        <li>Single line comments follow the //syntex, multi line comments are enclosed between the tags. /* and */.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. For example, if...else.</li>
        <li>Functions are are some of the building blocks of JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The developer first defines a body of code as a function, this will then execute when the developer calls the function in the code.</li>
        <li>Console.log is a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>          
        <li>The for loop is used to check certain conditions and then repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those codes are met.</li>
        <li>Identifying and solving bugs is a huge part of working with JavaScript.</li>
