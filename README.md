# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework.

The Webpage provides a list and summary notes covering the three main programming languages covered in this project namely, HTML, CSS and Javascript; and also 'Git' a local version control software. Note that the Git section also covers GitHub, a cloud based software that allows the user to share code.  

In addition to providing a range of features and somes rules regarding the three languages and Git/Github, the webpage was built to act as a reference point. That is, the user can conduct further research on each point using the Web etc. to gain more detailed information as required. It is hoped it will assist the user to 'ask the right questions'.  

Each of the programming languages covered and Git/GitHub are very complex and trying to gain an understanding of them completely is overwhelming. By building this webpage I have broken them down into smaller more managable parts. By increasing their knowledge of each component and writing code throughout this course the user will gain a better understanding of web design and coding. 

By gradually building this Prework Study Guide Webpage I came to appreciate how detailed building even a relatively simple webpage is and the importance of the methodology involved.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage can be used as a reference point. That is, can be used as a tool by using information contained in the notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/Github to conduct further research using the Web etc. to gain more detailed information as required. It is hoped it will assist the user to 'ask the right questions'.  

If we right click on the webpage and select the option 'Inspect', then the tab 'Console' we can see the JavaScript running.  It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
